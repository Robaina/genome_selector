## Select a subset of representative genomes from traits matrix and abundances


This package selects a genome subset of size _k_ from traits matrix (genomes vs presence/absence of enzymes) and relative abundances, such that functional diversity (enzyme set) is maximized and the selected genomes are representative of the entire community.
